 Machine Learning Assignment: MultiClass Classficationmodel
implement a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to perform multi-class classification on the Iris dataset. 
The goal is to predict the species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, 
or Virginica) based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
